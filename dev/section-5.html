        <h1>event history</h1>
        <p>American Bridal Show Company is a family owned and operated business.  My wife, Lisa, and I started American Bridal Show in 1992.  Our first show was in our hometown of Hillsborough, NJ at a local hall where my sister, Denise, and her husband, Ed, were catering. At the time we knew a great deal about advertising and about how to help our customers grow their businesses through doing it properly.It didn't take us long to learn how to use that knowledge to produce bridal shows that brought our customers great results.  Since then we have done over 2,000 shows which over 500,000 guests have attended. We appreciate all of our customers who put their trust in us to help them get  business and we are proud of the fact that many customers have been exhibiting at our shows for 15, 20 and even 25 years or more. In 2012, our son Tim, finished college and started working with us.  He is now our full partner in the business and works in creating the direction for the company, providing customer service, handling logistics, and being on site to run most of the shows, Lisa and I continue working on marketing, sales, customer service, and strategic planning. Looking forward to the next 25+ years of American Bridal Show Company!Sincerely, Rich Drozd.<p>
